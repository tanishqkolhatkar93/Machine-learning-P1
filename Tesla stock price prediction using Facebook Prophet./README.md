# Tesla stock price prediction 

- Dataset from Yahoo Finanace ( from 2020-11-17 to 2021-11-16 )     - TSLA.csv
-  Facebook Prophet
-  Forecast Evaluation using Google Finance in Google Sheets 
I plotted two graph using google sheet. First was to check the actual v predicted stock price. Second was future prediction from 17th November 2021 to !7th December 2021.


So the current price of Tesla is $1,084.90 It is $41 less than yesterday, and it has dropped by almost 5%.Tesla had an amazing year in 2020 and probably the best year so far. Tesla had 1200 person growth, or 12 times growth. The lowest price was $487.57 and the highest was $1,243.49. So that's 3 times growth. It is no wonder that Facebook Prophet is extremely bullish and confident that the price will rise in the future. Now, if somebody expects Tesla to have the same kind of growth in the future, it means the market cap of Tesla has to go from $1.088T * 12 to $7 trillion which is equal to the GDP of UK, France and India combined. So it is impossible for Tesla to have same kind of growth in the future.

So for the short term and for day traders, Tesla might be a good stock. For longer term, Not so much.

It's beyond 354.34. High PE ratio suggests that investors expect a high level of earnings in the future.
Tesla has an EPS of just $3.06. But this is a red flag. Market cap of $$1.088T with so less profit. This is a red flag. One year target estimate at less than current stock price. This is a red flag  and the 52 week range.
